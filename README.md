# Rachet #

    Rachet is a simple library to build some basic ML/DL models and accelerate them on GPU,
                without using popular libraries such as Tensorflow,Keras or PyTorch.

__Main reasons to build up this library is__:
    * Develope skillset on using libraries such as Numba
    * Learn most valuable design patterns in python 
    * Write unittests
    * Create valuable tutorials to help people learn basic ML/DL concepts and implementations from scratch.
